# get-kindle-highlights
If you're anything like me, you probably like to keep your Kindle hihglights on a separate location. I use a Trello board to keep a record of the books I read and any highlights I made. This is a little bookmarklet that lets you copy your highlights from your Kindle books.

## How use it:

1. Go to [http://enriquesanchez.mx/get-kindle-highlights/](http://enriquesanchez.mx/get-kindle-highlights/) and drag the bookmarklet link to your browser's bookmarks toolbar.
2. Go to [https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook](https://read.amazon.com/kp/notebook) and select a book from your list of books
3. Click the bookmarklet on your browser's bookmarks toolbar
4. Copy (cmd+c/ctrl+c) and paste your highlights on your location of choice.
